              Designing your home or office in a way that creates a symphony
              inside takes organized efforts. We have a defined process of how

                In this stage, we get detailed requirements for the work.
                Interior designers including the project manager attend this
                meeting to get to know the requirements well. The client shares
                whatever he/she needs.

                This is one of the core stages of the entire process. Our

                sure everything is on track.

                We submit the design to you so you can have a look at the design
                before we install it and give your feedback on it. We take your
                feedback to modify the design and work on it again accordingly.

                We implement the design in the spot with a proper setup. The
                operations team does this job while the project manager visits
                it to see if itâ€™s going on in the right way. Thus, you get an
                impressive design.
